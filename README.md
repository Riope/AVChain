# AVChain
Code for implementation of AVChain

This contains a prototype implementation of the architecture as discussed in the paper, "Trusted Sharing of Autonomous Vehicle Crash Data using
Enterprise Blockchain and IPFS": https://doi.org/10.1145/3594556.3594623

The Client application is the common client application containing the functionality for both AV Client application and Enterprise Client application. While the Smart Contract folder contains the smart contract to be deployed over the HLF network and the script that can be used to invoke the contract.

A running implementation of AVChain can be found here: https://avchain.abac.iitkgp.ac.in/
This web application is setup over the servers of IIT Kharagpur. The code for the web interface has not been provided in the main branch, this is to keep the web application interface flexible for the users or developers.
